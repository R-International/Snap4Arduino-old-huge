Snap4Arduino4Makers - Makers Branch of Snap4Arduino
===================================================

Snap4Arduino is a modified version of Snap for working with arduino boards and developed by edutec (http://s4a.cat/snap/).

The Makers branch (Snap4Arduino4Makers) is a derivate with new functionality for working with the "First Makers" initiative. It currently includes:

- Autodetection of an Arduino board at startup (no need to specify port path)
- Mac (OSX) version
- New "Makers" block group which includes: 
-- "auto connect arduino", "diconnect arduino", "

First Makers combines hardware (an Arduino shield) software (Scratch & Snap 4 Arduino modules and examples) and turorials for teachers & students.

The initiative is under development and will be promptly announced to the public.
