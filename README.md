Snap4Arduino - Makers Branch
=============================

Snap4Arduino is a modified version of Snap for working with arduino boards and developed by edutec (http://s4a.cat/snap/).

The Makers branch (Snap4Arduino4Makers) is a derivate with new functionality for working with the "First Makers" initiative.

First Makers combines hardware (an Arduino shield) software (Scratch & Snap 4 Arduino modules and examples) and turorials for teachers & students.

The initiative is under development and will be promptly announced to the public.
