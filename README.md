Snap4Arduino4Makers - Makers Branch of Snap4Arduino
===================================================

Snap4Arduino is a modified version of Snap for working with arduino boards and developed by edutec (http://s4a.cat/snap/).

The Makers branch (Snap4Arduino4Makers) is a derivate with new functionality for working with the "First Makers" initiative. It currently includes:

- Autodetection of an Arduino board at startup (no need to specify port path)
- Mac (OSX) version
- New "Makers" block group which includes: "auto connect arduino", "diconnect arduino", "is arduino connected", "led on", "led off", "switch", "temperature", "sound", "light", "potentiometer"

First Makers combines hardware (an Arduino shield) software (Scratch & Snap 4 Arduino modules and examples) and turorials for teachers & students.
